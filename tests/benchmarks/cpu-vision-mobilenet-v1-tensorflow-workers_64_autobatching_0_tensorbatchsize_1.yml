description: "An image-focused use-case that uses one network “backbone”: MobileNet V1, 
              which can be considered as one of the standards by the AI community. 
              To assess inference performance we’re recurring to COCO 2017 validation 
              dataset (a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset)"
